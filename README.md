## ü§ñ Complete Development Pipeline

This project demonstrates a full end-to-end machine learning workflow using modern, accessible tools:

### üè∑Ô∏è **Data Labeling with Roboflow**
- **Platform**: [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) - Industry-standard computer vision platform
- **Process**:
  - Collected diverse tiger images from various sources and angles
  - Used Roboflow's intuitive web-based annotation interface
  - Drew precise bounding boxes around tigers in each image
  - Applied smart annotation features like auto-labeling suggestions
- **Data Augmentation**: Leveraged Roboflow's built-in augmentation pipeline
  - Rotation, flip, brightness/contrast adjustments
  - Noise injection and blur effects for robustness
  - Automatic train/validation/test dataset splitting (70/20/10)
- **Quality Assurance**: Used Roboflow's dataset health check tools
- **Export**: Dataset exported in YOLOv8 PyTorch format with auto-generated YAML config

### üöÄ **Model Training with Google Colab**
- **Platform**: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) - Free GPU-accelerated Jupyter notebooks


### üåê **Web Application with Streamlit**
